### Data Sources
This dataset was obtained from 'The Data Society'. 


### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Tableau - Analysis/ Visualisation Report

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation 
In the initial data preparation phrase, we perform the following tasks:
1.  Data loading and inspection.
2.  Checking for missing values.
3.  Data formatting and creating Dashboard.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What's the total survival?
- What type of aircraft is involved in the most crashes
- Highest Fatalities by Location
- Operators with the highest crash rate


## Medothology

- The data was analyzed and cleaned using Excel and export to Tableau for visualization . 
- 	The were no missing values or duplicates.
- 	Some calculation were done in getting the total Airplane Crashes and Fatalities
- The data was limited to the top 10 to discover the aircraft, operator and location with the highest crash rate 
- 	Trend analysis was done to check between 1912 to 2006 on how airplane crash has increased or deprecated over time.
  
### Data Analysis 
To get the Total Fatalities, a calculated feild was created in Tableau which included;
```Tableau
 [Fatalities] + [Ground]
```

### Results/Findings
  The analysis results area summarized as follows:
  1. There total on board were 144,551, but only 30,752 survived.
  2. Douglas DC 3 has shown to have the higest plane crash with total of 334 which is three times higher than the next plane carsh.
  3. The rate of plan crash have significantly increased from 1912 to 1972 but began to decilne around 1973.
  4. The Highest record of Airplane crash and Facatilies was recorded in 1972 with over 2937 fatalities and the lowest was recorded in 2009 with about 581 fatalities
 5. Tenerife canery island is recorded as the highest plane crash by location.

## RECOMMENDATION
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions;
1.	Comprehensive Pre-Flight Maintenance:
Airline management should ensure that thorough maintenance checks are conducted on all aircraft, particularly after each drop-off. All systems and equipment must be verified as fully operational before takeoff to guarantee passenger and crew safety.
2.  In-Depth Investigation into Douglas DC-3 Manufacturing:
A detailed investigation should be conducted into the design and manufacturing of the Douglas DC-3 aircraft to determine any underlying issues contributing to repeated crashes. This research should involve collaboration with aviation experts, engineers, and regulatory bodies to identify and address any potential flaws.
3. Enhanced Safety Protocols:
Airline management should implement additional safety measures, including stricter pre-flight inspections, enhanced crew training, and improved emergency response procedures. Proactive risk management strategies must be deployed to minimize the likelihood of future incidents.
